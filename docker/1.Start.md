# What is Docker:

*Platform for building, sharing and running applications*

It is like having a VM ready for you to setup your application and libraries.

# What is a Container
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

# What is a Container Image
A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

## Simplifying concepts
**Think of a container image as a class**

**Think of a container as an instance**

# Installation on MacOS
[https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac/](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac/)

## Docker Info
`docker system info`

## Bash completion
`brew install docker-completion`

Make sure you have the following script in your bash_completion.d folder
[Docker Completion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/cli/master/contrib/completion/bash/docker)


# The Registry
In docker the **registry** is where images are stored. It is the **git server** for container images.

There are many *registries*, but the most important one(public) is [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)

Each **application** has a *Repository*. You can push your new versions of the same image to the repository, and use different tags like branches.

See the tags each image has:

[Maven Images](https://hub.docker.com/_/maven)

[Ruby Images](https://hub.docker.com/_/ruby)

# Running containers
`docker run hello-world`

**-it** : Run containers interactively
```
docker run -it --name myubuntu ubuntu /bin/bash
docker run -it --name projectx python:3.8
```
If you name your containers, you can start them later easily, with
`docker start projectx`


**-d** : Run in the background
```
docker run -d --name jenkins/jenkins
```

**-p localport:containerport** : map ports to reach your app
```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins
```

**--rm** : remove the container after it's finished
```
docker run --rm -it ubuntu /bin/bash
```

**--restart** : Set restart policy. Default: No, other options: `on-failure`, `always`, `unless-stopped`.

# How to build a container image
You build an image on top of another image. In docker images are made of layers that you stack one over the other.
First you have to choose a base image to build from.

## 1. Choose a base image from catalog
[Maven](https://hub.docker.com/_/maven)

For example: **maven:3.6.3-jdk-11**


## 2. Write a *Dockerfile*
[Dockerfile Reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/)

Some examples for simple `Dockerfile`s:

Maven application

```
FROM maven:3.6.3-jdk-11
CMD ["mvn", "-v"]
```

Python application

```
FROM python:3.7
CMD ["python", "/data/app/main.py"]
```

Node / Extended

```
FROM node:14.4

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY app ./

ENV APPENV qa
ENV SOMETHING else

LABEL version=10alpha
LABEL this=that

RUN npm install

CMD ["node", "server.js"]

EXPOSE 8080
```


## 3. Run the build command, and tag it so you can identify it later
`docker build -t projectx .`

## 4. List, review, inspect our images
```
docker images
docker history projectx
docker inspect projectx
```

## 5. Run our new image
`docker run projectx`

## 6. Debug: Run commands (no shell)
```
docker run projectx hostname
docker run projectx mvn -v
docker run projectx python -V
docker run projectx node -v
```
Run our image in the background:
```
docker run -d projectx sleep 300
```

## 6. Debug: Get inside a running container
`docker exec -it "containerid" /bin/bash`

## Check running containers
Now check the running containers with:
```
docker ps
docker ps -q
```

### Check all containers
`docker ps -a`

### Clean up
```
# see this usage
docker system df

# remove containers, volumes and networks
docker system prune

# remove all containers
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

# remove all volumes
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)
```
