# What is Docker:

*Platform for building, sharing and running applications*

It is like having a VM ready for you to setup your application and libraries.

# What is a Container
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

# What is a Container Image
A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

## Simplifying concepts
**Think of a container image as a class**

**Think of a container as an instance**

# Installation on MacOS

# Bash completion
Make sure you have the following script in your bash_completion.d folder
[Docker Completion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/cli/master/contrib/completion/bash/docker)

# The Registry
In docker the **registry** is where images are stored. It is the **git server** for container images.

There are many *registries*, but the most important one(public) is [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)

Each **Image** in a registry has a *Repository* just like an App has a git repo. You can push your new versions of the same image to the repository, and use different tags like branches.

See the tags each image has:

[Maven Images](https://hub.docker.com/_/maven)

[Ruby Images](https://hub.docker.com/_/ruby)

# Running containers
`docker run hello-world`

**-it** : Run containers interactively
```
docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
docker run -it python:3.8
```

**-d** : Run in the background
```
docker run -d jenkins/jenkins
```

**-p laptopport:containerport** : map ports to reach your app
```
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 jenkins/jenkins
```

**--rm** : remove the container after it's finished
```
docker run --rm -it ubuntu /bin/bash
```

# How to build a container image
You build an image on top of another image. In docker images are made of layers that you stack one over the other.
First you have to choose a base image to build from.

## 1. Choose a base image from catalog
[Maven](https://hub.docker.com/_/maven)

For example: **maven:3.6.3-jdk-11**


## 2. Write a *Dockerfile*
```
FROM maven:3.6.3-jdk-11
CMD ["mvn", "-v"]
```

## 3. Run the build command, and tag it so you can identify it later
`docker build -t mymaven .`

## 4. List, review, inspect our images
```
docker images
docker history mymaven
docker inspect mymaven
```

## 5. Run our new image
`docker run mymaven`

## 6. Debug: Run commands inside the container
```
docker run mymaven hostname
docker run mymaven mvn -v
docker run mymaven mvn -V
```
Run our image in the background:
```
docker run -d mymaven sleep 300
```

## 6. Debug: Get inside a running container
`docker exec -it "containerid" /bin/bash`

## Check running containers
Now check the running containers with:
```
docker ps
docker ps -q
```

### Check all containers
`docker ps -a`

### Clean up
```
docker system df
docker system prube
```
