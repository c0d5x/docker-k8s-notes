# What is Docker:

*Platform for building, sharing and running applications*

It is like having a VM ready for you to setup your application and libraries.

# What is a Container
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

# What is a Container Image
A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

**Think of a container image as a class**

**Think of a container as an instance**
