# Docker Compose
Helps you define multi-container environments.

Creates volumes and networks easily, and automatically.

Uses a `docker-compose.yml` to describe the containers/services that are part of the system.

## Installation Link
[Docker Compose Releases](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases)

`docker-compose version`

[Docker Compose Reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/)

# Simple `docker-compose.yml`
```
version: '3.1'

services:
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=postgres
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres

  ui:
    image: adminer
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
        - db

```

# Commands
```
# run all the services in the background
docker-compose up -d

# run all services in the foreground
docker-compose up

# stop all services
docker-compose down

# run only one service in background
docker-compose up -d

# other commands
docker-compose images
docker-compose ps
docker-compose rm
docker-compose events
```

Docker compose will create a network and make each service/host visible to the others, also ports can be accessed without having to describe them.

In this example, `web` has to be created after `db` is pulled and run, due to the `depends_on` statement. Ports are mapped in the same format.

# Adding a utility host
```
version: '3.1'

services:
  mypsql:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=postgres
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres

  mymysql:
    image: mysql
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysql

  gui:
    image: adminer
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
        - mypsql
        - mymysql

  ubuntu:
    image: ubuntu
```

The `ubuntu` service will stop because it doesn't have any commands to run, but it will be part of the default network created automatically, so we can use it to run commands.

# Adding volumes and building images
```
version: '3.1'

volumes:
  dbdata:

services:
  postgres:
    build: postgres
    volumes:
      - dbdata:/var/lib/pgsql/data
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"

  app:
    build: .
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    environment:
      - APPENV=QA
    command: >
      sh -c "cd /usr/src/app && python manage.py runserver"
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```

# Multiple networks
```
version: '3.1'

networks:
  frontend:
  backend:

services:
  proxy:
    image: debian
    networks:
      - frontend
    command: >
      sh -c "ping localhost"

  app:
    image: debian
    networks:
      - frontend
      - backend
    command: >
      sh -c "ping localhost"

  db:
    image: debian
    networks:
      - backend
    command: >
      sh -c "ping localhost"
```
When this runs, *proxy* and *db* can NOT see each other, but *app* can see both.
